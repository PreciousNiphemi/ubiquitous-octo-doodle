This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### PAGE LOAD TIME

Calculated Load time with Window.onload function to check when the page has loaded. I subtracted the time the after the page load from the time before the page load to get the page load time.
This is done using the new Date.getTime() object

### CHANGES TO OPTIMISE APP

[] I use lazy loading for code splitting to ensure the app load just the things currently needed by the user.
[] I used useMemo to memoize some constant values that might persist.

### TODO: Things That could be done different.

[] Integrate SQLite with react to increase performance and enable better queries. This give user freedom queries.
[] Implement history feature. User can check previous results of previous queries instead of running the same queries again. This will readuce load time of the app.
[] Manage data in a better way. Implement search algorithm to fetch result faster.
